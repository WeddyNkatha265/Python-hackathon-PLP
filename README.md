# Project Overview: CivicPulse
## Goal: CivicPulse empowers citizens to actively participate in local governance by reporting issues, receiving public safety alerts, and coordinating disaster response. The platform bridges the communication gap between citizens and authorities, promoting transparency, accountability, and community engagement.

# Features:
Issue Reporting: Citizens can report local issues (e.g., potholes, broken streetlights) with geolocation and photos.
Public Safety Alerts: Real-time alerts for emergencies (e.g., natural disasters, public safety threats).
Disaster Response Coordination: Volunteer coordination and resource distribution during disasters.
Civic Engagement: Polls, surveys, and feedback mechanisms to gather citizen input on local policies.
Technology Stack:
Backend: Flask (Python) with a PostgreSQL database.
Frontend: React.js for a responsive web interface.
Geolocation Services: Google Maps API for location tracking.
Push Notifications: Firebase for sending real-time alerts.
Deployment: Heroku for the backend, Netlify for the frontend.
